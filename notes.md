# Lesson 3 - CSS Variables and Live Updates
- You can define CSS variables 
- You can update CSS variables by using `document.documentElement.style.setProperty`
- You can name your inputs & give custom data attributes
- Data attributes allow you to define an element's "data set"
- You can easily add listeners to what querySelectorAll returns by using forEach. 
- querySelectorAll does not return an array, it returns a node list

# Lesson 4 - Array Cardio
- Array.prototype.filter() looks for a truthy result 
- Array.prototype.map() is useful for going through each item in array and mapping or extracting
- if statements using ternary are quick --> (statement) ? true : false
- Array.prototype.sort() compares 2 values at a time, looking for 1 or -1 from a function
- Array.prototype.reduce() 'save results' from each item or task - need to declare starting object or value

# Lesson 5 - Flex Panel Gallery
- Can define before state and after state in CSS
- CSS before and after state can have a transition
- Javascript can trigger this state change
- Javascript can listen for a state change (transitionend) and perform something new
- flex: 1 for many elements is equal distribution, if one element has flex: 5 it means it takes 5x as much space as the other
- justify-content: center & align-items: center are your new best friends
